    <h2>Living in Nashville</h2>
    <section>Sharing a home with my business partner has been fun, so far. As I've never had a roommate, I've had to make sure to hold my tounge concerning spaces that aren't mine. The communal space, however, is fair game. I require and excellently-maintained domicile, and expect nothing less from my business partner, either!</section>
